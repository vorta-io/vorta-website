        <span class="feature-title">Introduction</span>

        <p class="text-just">
          Gazzda is our first client and the one where our story starts.  In 2016, Vorta was a young company made out of experienced software product builders that have worked for  US software industry and went to start the company of their own. Vorta and Gazzda met shortly after and agreed to form a partnership where Vorta would come with our product building expertise and Gazzda would bring their Supply Chain expertise to work together to bring supply chain solution that would meet the needs of Gazzda as a company.
        </p>
        <p class="text-just">
          Task was pretty daunting, since building software of this scale requires a lot of planning and work. Fact that our today’s competition charges hundreds thousands of euros just for the implementation testifies about technical complexities of these types of softwares. From Vorta’s inception vision of what the software needs to be was clearly defined, solutions needs to be simple and agile so that it can fit in other businesses organisations without the need to rebuild its core parts. In addition to that it needed to be commercialisation ready and disruptive enough to offer us competitive edge in a market saturated with ERP solutions. Vorta defined there main goals as a company at that point.

          <b>Keep it simple.</b> Simple is hard, and we were ready to the hard work. Our user experience and our onboarding process had to be simple. Two reasons for that were the vision and practicality since we as a small company could not take on complex solutions and expect not to be dragged down with complex implementation and maintenance. 
        </p>
        <p class="text-just">
          <b>Be different.</b> Not very original we know :) but still great goal to have. In the beginning we decided we are not gonna be YAERP (Yet Another ERP) and we wanted to offer something different to the market. Goal was to provide fast supply chain implementation (under two months) and have a product which is liked not only by CEO and CFO on that faithful sales demo, but their employees as well. 
        </p>
        <p class="text-just">
          <b>Plan ahead.</b> During the last 3 years of our development we made challenges for us. We would find a B2B company and in house plan their implementation. The goal of these exercises was simple, continuously test our solution with real world problems and recognize potential issues in time so that our processes can be tweaked accordingly.

      <p class="text-just">
        With these goals in mind we have developed Vorta as a solution. Following is a case study that will reflect on challenges and benefits of this partnership. We at Vorta feel really lucky to have met Gazzda, company that had a vision and grit to even try partnership like this. We love working with Gazzda and we will continue to do so. We find that our customer needs always comes first and we are happy to have such a talented and innovative company as our client.

        <span class="feature-title">CHALLENGE I: Meeting the demand</span>

        <p class="text-just">
          Gazzda is one of the Bosnia and Herzegovina great business stories. They started in 2007 and grew fast as a company. Three years ago demand for Gazzda’s products grew rapidly and soon it became demanding for them to meet demand without increasing the overhead of additional personnel and the introduction of new procedures to keep up with demand. Their B2B clients are all over Europe and some of them are overseas. All stakeholders in their chain have different lead times, delivery terms, special delivery requests,  and of course different minimum order quantities and prices.  They needed simplified & unified language between all stakeholders which would be easily maintainable but also able to meet their customers' demands.
