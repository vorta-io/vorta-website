        Vorta was founded in 2016. We started as a small startup with four people, and we are continually growing as an efficient team that combines expertise in supply chain management and software building.
        We feel very lucky to have been given an opportunity to bring something new in the honestly a very stale and dull world of business applications that almost never focus on building a great product. 
      </p>
      <p style="font-size: 1.8rem;">
        We are big believers in keeping things simple. We found that every move we made towards simplicity has always paid off. Payoffs are not obvious at first but when you get deep into it, you will realize that simpler things reduce the number of errors, make things easy to use, and push innovation forward.
        Innovation is the real strength of Vorta, and we offer solutions that are unique and save a lot of time. In years to come, we plan to continue to make big bets on simplicity, clarity, and honesty. This goes for our products and our company.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size: 1.8rem;">
        Treating people right is fundamental to how we do business. We treat our customers as we’d want to be treated, with honesty and clarity in our interactions. If we cannot solve your problems we will be straightforward and upfront about it. You will never meet our sales team only, you will meet consultants and engineers that built Vorta. We will analyze your business, provide consultancy and solutions only when there is additional value to be added.
        If we feel that our product is not a good fit for your company we will be honest about it and not waste your time, and ruin our reputation just to earn another dollar. We want customers that are happy with our product and without a shadow of a doubt know the value that Vorta brings. We know we have a great product and we want it to have a positive impact on the industry and the world around us. In return, we will continue making it better and better.
      </p>
      
      <p style="font-size: 1.8rem; margin-bottom: 3em;">
        If you’re just browsing, enjoy your stay. If you’d like to become a customer, we’d love to have you. Either way, thanks for visiting Vorta, and have a great day!
